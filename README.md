# Flash Cards

This is a small spaced repetition flash card app, using Rails, Angular,
and Bootstrap. It's far from complete (for example, it's single-user).
Mostly just something I'm playing with to learn these frameworks better.

## Installation

Requires Ruby 2.2+ and Postgres. Then in the root project directory:

    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rails server
